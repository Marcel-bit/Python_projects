# Python_projects
My projects when i was 13.
I started programming in school in 4th grade. We we're programming in scratch. In 5th and 6th grade i went to the national programming competition and got silver recognition award
At the start of 6th grade i moved to python. I was self teaching. in 7th grade i signed up for python competition. In late winter 2019 i moved to national programming competition but because of coronavirus.
I created this so i can laugh when im older.
